title:  Eighth OCaml compiler hacking evening (at Mill Lane, by the river)

For the eighth Cambridge OCaml compiler hacking evening we'll be meeting in the [University Postdoc centre](http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/first-ever-postdoc-centre-is-new-home-for-research-staff) at [16 Mill Lane](https://goo.gl/maps/cZXev) (near the river, next door to [Makespace](http://makespace.org/space/)) on 6.30pm Tuesday 30th September.

If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could [**indicate interest via Doodle**](http://doodle.com/svwkevcs5p2xs8n8) and [sign up to the mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/cam-compiler-hacking) to receive updates:

**Where**:
  Postdoc Centre  
  Basement, [16 Mill Lane](https://goo.gl/maps/cZXev)  
  Cambridge, CB2 1SB  
  United Kingdom  

**When**: 6.30pm, Tuesday 30th September

**Who**: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.

**What**: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals.  This time we'll be focusing on code quality: refactoring, adding test cases, reviewng existing proposals and updating packages after the recent [release of OCaml 4.02](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2014-08/msg00127.html).

**Wiki**: [https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki](https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki)

We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the [standard library][stdlib], [runtime][runtime], tools ([ocamldep][ocamldep], [ocamllex][ocamllex], [ocamlyacc][ocamlyacc], etc.), [ocamlbuild][ocamlbuild], the [documentation][ocaml-documentation], and the compiler itself. We'll have suggestions for [mini-projects][things-to-work-on] for various levels of experience (see also some [things we've done on previous evenings][things-worked-on]), but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.

We'll also be ordering pizza, so if you want to be counted for food you should aim to arrive by 6.45pm.
