It's time for the third Cambridge OCaml compiler-hacking session! This time we're going to be back in the [Computer Lab](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), where the first session was held.

If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could [*indicate interest via Doodle*](http://doodle.com/czzp7ik4r72npz6p) and [*sign up to the mailing list*](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/cam-compiler-hacking) to receive updates:

*Where*: Room [FW11](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/openroommap/static/?s=FW11&amp;labels=1), [Computer Laboratory, Madingley Road](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/directions/)

*When*: 6pm, Wednesday 6th November

*Who*: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.

*What*: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals

*Wiki*: [https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki](https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki)

We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the [standard library](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/libref/index.html), [runtime](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual024.html), tools ([ocamldep](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.01/depend.html), [ocamllex](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc105), [ocamlyacc](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html#toc107), etc.), [camlp4](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-camlp4/manual002.html), [ocamlbuild](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual032.html), the [documentation](http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/index.en.html), and the compiler itself. We'll have suggestions for [mini-projects](https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on) for various levels of experience, but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.

We'll also be ordering pizza, so if you want to be counted for food you should aim to arrive by 6.30pm.
