title:  Fifteenth OCaml compiler hacking evening at Pembroke
date:   2016-11-01 21:30:00

​Our Autumn Compiler Hacking event will be held at Pembroke College! We are also inviting MirageOS users and devs to prepare for Mirage 3.0.

If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could [indicate interest via Doodle](http://doodle.com/poll/fsy7gue9xvbvvdm8) and [sign up to the mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/admin/cam-compiler-hacking) to receive updates.

_**Where**__: N7 Pembroke College  
Cambridge​  
CB2 1RF  

N7 is through the second arch and on the left.

_**When**_: 630pm, Wednesday 9th November

_**Who**_: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.

_**What**_: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals

Refreshments: either the Pembroke buttery between 545-645pm (cash only) or there will be a finger buffet in N7 itself.

We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the
 [standard library](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/stdlib),
 [run](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/byterun)[time](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/asmrun), tools
    ([ocamldep](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/depend.html),
     [ocamllex](https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html),
     [ocamlyacc](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html), etc.), the
 [debugger](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/debugger.html), the
 [documentation](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/manual), and the
 [compiler](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) itself. We'll have
 [suggestions for mini-projects](https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on) for various levels of experience, but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.
