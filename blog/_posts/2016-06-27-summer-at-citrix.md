​Our summer compiler hacking event will be hosted by Euan and the Citrix Team on Thursday 7th​ July — come and explore the other side of Cambridge and the Science Park!

If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could [indicate interest via Doodle](http://doodle.com/poll/kykn2fxzgbqrdc3h) and [sign up to the mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/admin/cam-compiler-hacking) to receive updates.

_**Where**_: [Citrix Systems Research & Development Ltd.](https://goo.gl/maps/pVRvLfVNMb12)  
  Building 10​1, ​
  Cambridge  
  Science Park​,  
  Milton Road​,  
  Cambridge​   
  CB4 0FY​   

_**When**_: 7pm, Thursday 7th July

_**Who**_: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.

_**What**_: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals

_**Refreshments**_: pizza and beer/other drinks will be available.

We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the
 [standard library](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/stdlib),
 [run](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/byterun)[time](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/asmrun), tools
    ([ocamldep](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/depend.html),
     [ocamllex](https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html),
     [ocamlyacc](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html), etc.), the
 [debugger](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/debugger.html), the
 [documentation](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/manual), and the
 [compiler](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) itself. We'll have
 [suggestions for mini-projects](https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on) for various levels of experience, but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.
