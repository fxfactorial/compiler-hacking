It's time for the eleventh Cambridge OCaml compiler-hacking evening! This time we're heading to central Cambridge, to enjoy all that [Pembroke College](http://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/) has to offer.

If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could **indicate interest [via Doodle](http://doodle.com/poll/r5u7gzk5qqbq52u4)** and sign up to the [mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/cam-compiler-hacking) to receive updates.

_**Where**_: Outer Parlour, [Pembroke College](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Pembroke+College/@52.2018741,0.1177328,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d870a2a3162b45:0x178705666a5d2498), Cambridge CB2 1RF. Head through the entrance on Trumpington Street, and we'll be there at the Porter's Lodge to direct you.

_**When**_: 6pm, Monday 30th November

_**Who**_: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.

_**What**_: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals

_**Wiki**_: https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki

We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the [standard library](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/stdlib), [run](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/byterun)[time](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/asmrun), tools ([ocamldep](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/depend.html), [ocamllex](https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html), [ocamlyacc](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html), etc.), [camlp4](https://github.com/ocaml/camlp4), [ocamlbuild](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-400/manual032.html), the [documentation](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-manual), [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/), and the [compiler](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) itself. We'll have [suggestions for mini-projects](https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on) for various levels of experience, but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.

Drinks and finger buffet will be provided.
