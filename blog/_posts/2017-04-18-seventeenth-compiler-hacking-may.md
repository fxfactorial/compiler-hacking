Our next OCaml Compiler Hacking event will be on Tuesday 16th May in The Old Library at Pembroke College, Cambridge.

If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could [indicate interest via Doodle](https://doodle.com/poll/dxvcih4d9en2t5vy) and [sign up to the mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/admin/cam-compiler-hacking) to receive updates.

_**Where**_: The Old Library, Pembroke College​, ​Cambridge​ ​CB2 1RF

​The Old Library is the first building on the left straight after the Porters Lodge.

_**When**_: 6:30pm, Tuesday 16​th ​May

_**Who**_: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.

_**Refreshments**_: either the Pembroke buttery between 5:45-6:45pm (cash only) or there will be a finger buffet in​ The Old Library​ itself.

_**What**_: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals

_**Wiki**_: https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki

We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the
 [standard library](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/stdlib),
 [run](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/byterun)[time](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/asmrun), tools
    ([ocamldep](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/depend.html),
     [ocamllex](https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html),
     [ocamlyacc](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html), etc.), the
 [debugger](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/debugger.html), the
 [documentation](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/manual), and the
 [compiler](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) itself. We'll have
 [suggestions for mini-projects](https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on) for various levels of experience, but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.
