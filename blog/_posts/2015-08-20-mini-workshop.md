title:  Tenth OCaml compiler hacking evening and OCaml/ML talks
date:   2015-08-20 12:00:00
---

We'll be meeting in the Computer Lab next Friday (28th August 2015) for another evening of compiler hacking.  All welcome!

We'll also be having an afternoon of OCaml- and ML-related talks beforehand, with titles suspiciously similar to talks at the [ML Workshop](http://www.mlworkshop.org/ml2015/) and [OCaml Workshop](https://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2015/) the following week.

If you're planning to come along to either the talks or to compiler hacking, please **[add yourself to the Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/82arpxipidgqbvwi)**.  Further updates, if any, will be posted to the [compiler hacking mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/cam-compiler-hacking).

### Schedule

3.30pm **Polymorphism, subtyping and type inference in MLsub**

### Further details

**Where**: Room [FW26](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/openroommap/static/?s=FW26&amp;labels=1), [Computer Laboratory, Madingley Road](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/directions/)

**When**: 3.30pm (workshop); 6.30pm (compiler hacking), Friday 28th August 2015

**Who**: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.

**What**: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals.

We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the [standard library][stdlib], [runtime][runtime], tools ([ocamldep][ocamldep], [ocamllex][ocamllex], [ocamlyacc][ocamlyacc], etc.), [ocamlbuild][ocamlbuild], the [documentation][ocaml-documentation], and the compiler itself. We'll have suggestions for [mini-projects][things-to-work-on] for various levels of experience (see also some [things we've done on previous evenings][things-worked-on]), but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.
