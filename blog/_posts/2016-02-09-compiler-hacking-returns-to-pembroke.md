It's time for the twelfth Cambridge OCaml compiler-hacking evening! We'll be back in [Pembroke College][pembroke] again, in the centre of Cambridge.

If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could [indicate interest via Doodle][doodle] and sign up to the mailing list to receive updates:

Where: N7, Pembroke College, Cambridge CB2 1RF. Head through the entrance on Trumpington Street, and we'll be there at the Porter's Lodge to direct you.

When: 7pm, Wednesday 17th February.

Who: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.

What: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals

We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the standard library, runtime, tools (ocamldep, ocamllex, ocamlyacc, etc.), camlp4, ocamlbuild, the documentation, and the compiler itself. We'll have suggestions for mini-projects for various levels of experience, but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.

Drinks and finger buffet will be provided.
